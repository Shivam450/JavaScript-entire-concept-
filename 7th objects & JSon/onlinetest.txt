JSON.Stringify() is a JavaScript method that converts a JavaScript object into a JSON string. It serializes only the enumerable own properties of an object, which means it only includes the properties of the object that are directly defined on the object itself, and not any properties inherited from its prototype or other objects.
var materials = ['Table', 'Chair', 'Boxes', 'Press'];                             console.log(materials.map(material => material.length)); The code uses the map() method on the "materials" array to create a new array by applying a function to each element of the original array. The function used calculates the length of each string in the "materials" array using the arrow function syntax, and the resulting array will contain the lengths of the strings in the original array, which are all 5 characters long.
Serialization is the process of converting an object's state to a string from which it can later be restored. It involves converting the object's properties and values into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted, such as JSON or XML.
NaN, Infinity, and -Infinity are special numeric values in JavaScript that cannot be represented in JSON. When these values are serialized using JSON.stringify(), they are converted to "null" in JSON.
/*o = {                                     x: 1,                                      y: {                                      z: [false, null, ""]                        } };            s = JSON.stringify(o);                     p = JSON.parse(s);The given JavaScript code snippet demonstrates object serialization, which is the process of converting a JavaScript object into a JSON string using the JSON.stringify() method. The resulting JSON string can then be parsed back into a JavaScript object using the JSON.parse() method, which is known as deserialization. Hence, the correct answer is "Object Serialization".
